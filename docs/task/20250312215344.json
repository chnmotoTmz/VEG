The `select_scenes` method in `scene_selection.py` should accept a scenario string (e.g., 'introduction') and return a list of `Scene` objects matching the scenario.  The `add_narration` method in `narration_addition.py` should append the generated narration to the `Scene` object.  The `LanguageHandler` class in `utils.py` should be responsible for converting language names to language codes.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The format of SRT files (timestamps and text), the expected input format for scenario selection (keywords, time ranges), and the desired output format for the narration (append or replace) need clarification.  Specific details on the Serper API's expected input and output format need to be defined.  Error handling for invalid SRT file formats, invalid API keys, and incorrect user input should be implemented.  The exact functionality of the scenario selection process (e.g., how to specify time ranges) needs to be defined."}
