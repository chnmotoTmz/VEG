Create two Python applications with Tkinter GUI: a #Scene Selection Tool# that selects scenes from an SRT file based on a scenario, and a #Narration Addition Tool# that adds narration to the selected scenes using the Gemini API. Both tools should support English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, include an option for web search via Serper API, retrieve API keys from environment variables, and feature modular design with error handling and user feedback.
