## Programming Language

Python

## Original Requirements

Create two Python applications with Tkinter GUI: a #Scene Selection Tool# that selects scenes from an SRT file based on a scenario, and a #Narration Addition Tool# that adds narration to the selected scenes using the Gemini API. Both tools should support English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, include an option for web search via Serper API, retrieve API keys from environment variables, and feature modular design with error handling and user feedback.

## Project Name

srt_scene_tools

## Product Goals

- Provide a user-friendly interface for SRT file scene selection and narration.
- Enable efficient and accurate narration addition using the Gemini API.
- Support multiple languages for global accessibility.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select scenes from an SRT file based on a specific scenario.
- As a user, I want to add narration to the selected scenes using the Gemini API.
- As a user, I want to choose the language for the narration and search.
- As a user, I want to see clear error messages and feedback if something goes wrong.

## Competitive Analysis

- No existing tools found specifically combining SRT scene selection and Gemini API narration.
- Other SRT editors may offer scene selection, but lack integration with AI narration.
- Some video editing software has narration features, but might not be suitable for SRT files.

## Competitive Quadrant Chart



## Requirement Analysis

The project needs to handle SRT file parsing, scene selection based on user criteria, Gemini API integration for narration, support for multiple languages, and error handling for various potential issues (invalid file paths, API errors, etc.).  Modular design is crucial for maintainability and extensibility.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'SRT file parsing and scene extraction.']
- ['P0', 'Scene selection based on user criteria (e.g., timestamps, keywords).']
- ['P1', 'Gemini API integration for narration generation.']
- ['P1', 'Support for English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.']
- ['P2', 'Web search functionality via Serper API.']

## UI Design draft

The Scene Selection Tool will have a file upload area, a text box for scenario input, and a listbox displaying selectable scenes. The Narration Addition Tool will have a text area for the narration, language selection, and a button to trigger the Gemini API call. Error messages will be displayed prominently.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Specific details on the format of the SRT files, the expected input for scenario selection, and the desired output format for the narration need clarification.
